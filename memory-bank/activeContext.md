# Active Context - wdio-qmate-service

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Mature & Stable
The project is in a mature, stable state with version 3.4.0 representing a well-established codebase with comprehensive functionality across all intended domains.

### Recent Context Discovery
Based on analysis of the current codebase structure and files:

#### Core Architecture Established
- **WebDriverIO Service**: Main service class with complete lifecycle hooks (onPrepare, beforeSession, before, after, onComplete)
- **Global Namespace System**: Comprehensive global API organization through reuse library
- **Modular Design**: Well-structured modules for ui5, nonUi5, mobile, service, common, util, and flp domains
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Full TypeScript support with type definitions

#### Key Implementation Areas
1. **Authentication System**: Multiple authenticator types (basic, form, custom, plain) with enterprise support
2. **Testing Modules**: Complete implementation across all target domains
3. **Documentation System**: MkDocs-based documentation with auto-generation from JSDoc
4. **Build System**: TypeScript compilation with source maps and type generation
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites covering all modules

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Priorities
Since this appears to be a stable, mature project, typical next steps would involve:

1. **Maintenance & Updates**
   - Dependency updates and security patches
   - Bug fixes based on user feedback
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Feature Enhancement**
   - New UI5 control support as SAP releases updates
   - Additional authentication mechanisms based on enterprise needs
   - Mobile testing capabilities expansion

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Documentation improvements
   - Example expansion
   - IDE integration enhancements

### Active Decisions & Considerations

#### Development Patterns
- **Global Namespace Strategy**: Maintains clean, intuitive API through global object injection
- **Modular Architecture**: Each domain (ui5, mobile, etc.) is self-contained with clear boundaries
- **TypeScript First**: All new functionality developed in TypeScript with full type safety
- **WebDriverIO Integration**: Deep integration with WebDriverIO lifecycle and ecosystem

#### Code Organization Principles
- **Domain Separation**: Clear separation between ui5, nonUi5, mobile, service, common, util, flp
- **Reusable Functions**: Common functionality abstracted into util and common modules
- **Configuration-Driven**: Authentication and behavior controlled through WebDriverIO config
- **Hook-Based Lifecycle**: Proper integration with WebDriverIO's hook system

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### API Design Philosophy
- **Intuitive Naming**: Function names clearly describe their purpose (`expectToBeVisible`, `navigateToUrl`)
- **Consistent Parameters**: Similar parameter patterns across modules for predictability
- **Async/Await**: All asynchronous operations use async/await pattern
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages

### Testing Approach
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests
- **Real Browser Testing**: Tests run against actual browsers and mobile devices
- **Authentication Testing**: Separate test suites for different authentication scenarios
- **Platform Coverage**: Tests for Linux, mobile platforms, and different browser engines

### Documentation Standards
- **JSDoc Comments**: All public functions documented with JSDoc
- **Auto-Generation**: Documentation generated from source code comments
- **MkDocs Integration**: Structured documentation site with examples
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for IDE support

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Success Factors
1. **Global Namespace Approach**: Eliminates import complexity while maintaining modularity
2. **SAP Integration**: Deep UI5 integration provides significant value over generic tools
3. **Authentication Abstraction**: Solving enterprise authentication complexity is critical
4. **TypeScript Adoption**: Full TypeScript implementation improves developer experience significantly

### Technical Decisions
- **CommonJS Modules**: Uses CommonJS for compatibility with WebDriverIO ecosystem
- **Source Maps**: Maintains debugging capability in compiled JavaScript
- **Flexible Configuration**: WebDriverIO config drives behavior without forcing specific patterns
- **Hook Integration**: Proper WebDriverIO service implementation with all lifecycle hooks

### Architecture Evolution
The project has evolved from basic WebDriverIO service to comprehensive testing platform:
- Started with core WebDriverIO integration
- Added domain-specific modules (ui5, nonUi5, mobile)
- Implemented enterprise authentication
- Built comprehensive documentation system
- Established robust testing infrastructure

This active context reflects the current state and ongoing patterns that should guide any future development work.
