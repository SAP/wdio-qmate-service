# Active Context: Initial Project Setup

## Current Focus
The current focus is on setting up the project's memory bank to establish a baseline understanding of the Qmate Service. This involves analyzing the existing codebase and documentation to populate the core memory bank files.

## Recent Changes
- Populated `projectbrief.md` with a high-level overview of the project.
- Populated `techContext.md` with details about the project's technologies, dependencies, and scripts.
- Populated `systemPatterns.md` with an analysis of the project's architecture and design patterns.
- Populated `productContext.md` with information about the project's purpose and features.

## Next Steps
- Populate `progress.md` to track the project's status and future work.
- Begin to address any issues or feature requests, now that the initial context is established.
