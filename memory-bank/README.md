# Memory Bank - wdio-qmate-service

## Overview
This Memory Bank contains comprehensive context about the wdio-qmate-service project. After each memory reset, I rely ENTIRELY on these files to understand the project and continue work effectively.

## Core Files (Read in Order)

### 1. [projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)
**Foundation Document** - Defines core mission, goals, and project scope
- Project identity and version information
- Primary goals and target users
- Key value propositions and success criteria
- Project boundaries and dependencies

### 2. [productContext.md](./productContext.md)
**Product Vision** - Why this project exists and how it should work
- Problems solved in SAP testing ecosystem
- User experience goals and workflows
- Expected outcomes and target user journeys

### 3. [activeContext.md](./activeContext.md)
**Current Work Focus** - Present state and immediate priorities
- Current project status (mature, stable)
- Recent discoveries and next steps
- Important patterns and preferences
- Key learnings and project insights

### 4. [systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md)
**Architecture & Design** - System architecture and technical decisions
- Core service patterns and global namespace injection
- Key architectural decisions and component relationships
- Design patterns in use and critical implementation paths

### 5. [techContext.md](./techContext.md)
**Technology Stack** - Technologies, dependencies, and development setup
- Core technologies (Node.js, TypeScript, WebDriverIO)
- Dependencies architecture and build configuration
- Technical constraints and integration points

### 6. [progress.md](./progress.md)
**Current Status** - What works, what's left, and project evolution
- Completed features across all modules
- Known issues and technical debt
- Evolution of project decisions and success metrics

## How to Use This Memory Bank

### For New Tasks
1. **Always read ALL core files** - This is mandatory, not optional
2. **Start with projectbrief.md** - Understand the foundation
3. **Follow the numbered sequence** - Each file builds on previous ones
4. **Update files when context changes** - Keep the memory bank current

### For Continuing Work
- Check **activeContext.md** for current focus areas
- Reference **systemPatterns.md** for architecture decisions
- Use **techContext.md** for technical implementation details
- Update **progress.md** when major work is completed

### For Memory Bank Updates
When user requests "**update memory bank**":
1. Review ALL files for accuracy
2. Update relevant sections based on recent work
3. Ensure consistency across all files
4. Add new insights or patterns discovered
