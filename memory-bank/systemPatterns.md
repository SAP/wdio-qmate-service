# System Patterns: Qmate Service

## High-Level Architecture
The Qmate Service is architected as a modular system with a clear separation of concerns. The core logic is encapsulated within a `reuse` library, which provides reusable modules and helpers for various testing scenarios. The `scripts` directory contains scripts that leverage the `reuse` library to perform specific tasks, such as test execution and data handling.

## Key Architectural Patterns
- **Modular Design:** The project is divided into modules, each with a specific responsibility (e.g., authentication, data exchange, UI5 controls). This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Service-Oriented:** As a WebdriverIO service, it integrates with the WebdriverIO ecosystem and provides services to test runners.
- **Helper/Utility Functions:** A significant portion of the codebase consists of helper and utility functions to simplify common testing tasks.
- **Configuration-driven:** The service relies on configuration files to customize its behavior for different testing environments and scenarios.

## Directory Structure
- `src/reuse`: Contains the core reusable library, with modules for authentication, data handling, UI5/non-UI5 controls, and more.
- `src/scripts`: Contains scripts for various purposes, including hooks, locators, and statistics.
- `src/bin`: Contains executable scripts, such as the types generator.
- `test`: Contains a comprehensive set of tests, mirroring the structure of the `src` directory.
